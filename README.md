## Objective
This exercise shows how to solve the expedition of a Sales Taxes Receipt without use any kind of framework.

## Solution 1
This is the fastest implementation of the problem.
In case a quick solution is required, designed directly to solve the requested problem, this works well.
Main features:
* Applies only sequential and structured coding techniques.
* This solution does not have the ability to be tested with the test libraries.
* This solution should not to be used for production purposes because it does not have a reliable control flow.
* As we can not perform a set of tests, we can not ensure 100% of your achievements.

## Solution 2
This solution is OO and is a bit more complex than the previous one.
It could be a first approach to a production solution, testable, but limited to be scaled.
Main features:
* Applies OO coding techniques, introducing simple classes.
* It has the ability to be tested and verified.
* This solution should be used for production purposes in small pieces of software where the scalability or the interconectivity is not a priority.
* As we can perform a set of test, we can ensure that it works well for know cases (specific cases or defined by rules).
